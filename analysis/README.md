## Graph 1: Correlation Between Cataclysms and Average Product Prices

![Correlation: Cataclysms vs Average Product Prices](./Correlation-cataclysms-avg-product-prices.png)

This line graph provides a visual representation of the correlation between the average prices of essential commodities such as coffee, wheat, and corn (measured in USD per pound) against the total monthly count of cataclysmic events over a period from 1990 to 2000.

**Creation** üõ†Ô∏è: I set up a line chart with the dates on the horizontal axis to track changes over time, and the USD price on the vertical axis. I then added each data series, choosing distinct colors for clarity. I made sure to aggregate the data by month to smooth out any short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends. 

Key observations from the graph include:
- **Average Coffee Price Fluctuations** ‚òïÔ∏è: The price of coffee per pound shows volatility over the observed period, with notable peaks that do not seem to directly correlate with cataclysmic events. This might suggest that coffee prices are influenced by other market factors beyond the scope of natural disasters.

- **Wheat Price Peaks** üåæ: The wheat price per pound demonstrates a clear peak around 1995, which aligns with a noticeable spike in the total count of cataclysms. This indicates a potential direct impact of climatic events on wheat prices, likely due to supply disruptions caused by such disasters.

- **Corn Price Trends** üåΩ: Corn prices also exhibit fluctuations, though less pronounced than wheat, and do not display a consistent correlation with the cataclysm count. This could imply a more complex set of factors affecting corn prices, where climatic events are only one of many influences.

## Graph 2: Distribution of Total Crime Count Across US States

![Distribution: Total Crime Count across US States](./Distribution-total-crime-count-US-states.png)

This bar chart displays the total crime count distributed across various US states for the period 1990-2000. The data highlight significant variations in crime rates between states, with some states showing markedly higher counts than others.

**Creation** üõ†Ô∏è: I placed the state names on the horizontal axis and the crime counts on the vertical axis to compare the data at a glance. Using a vertical bar graph allowed for an intuitive understanding of the differences between states. I chose a color that would stand out and sorted the bars in descending order to highlight the states with the highest crime rates prominently.

Key observations:
- **Variations Across States** üá∫üá∏: There is a noticeable decrease in crime counts from states like New York and New Jersey to states like Colorado and Missouri, suggesting possible correlations with state population sizes, urbanization rates, or law enforcement policies.

## Graph 3: Correlation Between Top 5 Cataclysms and Maximum Corn Price

![Correlation: Top 5 Cataclysms vs Maximum Corn Price](./Correlation-top-5-cataclysms-max-corn-price.png)

The presented heatmap focuses on the relationship between five major types of cataclysms and the maximum corn prices during the 1990s. Each horizontal band represents a different cataclysm type, with the color gradient indicating the corn price level during these events.

**Creation** üõ†Ô∏è: I plotted the maximum corn price per pound against the time on the horizontal axis and categorized by the type of climatic event on the vertical axis. The color intensity represents the price range, with darker shades indicating higher prices. This visualization technique is particularly effective for spotting patterns or anomalies over time and across different categories of climatic events, allowing for a quick assessment of how weather conditions might correlate with fluctuations in commodity prices.

Here are the observations:
- **Predominance of Droughts** ‚òÄÔ∏è: The graph clearly shows that drought periods correspond to the highest peaks in corn prices, suggesting that droughts have a substantial impact on the supply and, consequently, the cost of corn.
- **Lesser Impact of Other Events** ‚ùÑÔ∏è: While tropical cyclones, winter storms, flooding, and severe storms are also represented, their color intensity is less pronounced than that for droughts, indicating a lower correlation with the highest corn prices.

## Graph 4: Correlation Between Cataclysms and Minimum Crime Offender Count per Day

![Correlation: Cataclysms vs Minimum Crime Offender Count per Day](./Correlation-cataclysms-min-crime-offender-count-day.png)

The treemap provides a visualization of the minimum crime offender count per day in relation to various types of cataclysms. Each colored section represents a different type of cataclysm and its proportional contribution to the minimum crime offender count recorded.

**Creation** üõ†Ô∏è: I grouped the data by the type of cataclysm and used the metric of minimum crime offenders to size each block. The blocks are color-coded and proportionally sized according to the frequency of each cataclysm type, with larger blocks indicating a higher occurrence. This visualization helps to quickly identify which types of cataclysms are most prevalent and their relative impact on crime, highlighting the most significant climatic events that correlate with the lowest number of crime offenders.

Observations from the graph:
- **Dominance of Tropical Cyclones** üå™Ô∏è: Tropical cyclones appear most frequently in the dataset, suggesting a potential correlation with days of lower crime rates.

- **Variety of Cataclysmic Events** ‚òÅÔ∏è: Other events such as freezes, floods, and severe storms also seem to contribute to days with lower crime offender counts.

- **Rare Incidences** ‚òÄÔ∏è: Some cataclysm types, like droughts, show minimal correlation with the crime offender count, possibly due to their less immediate impact on daily activities compared to more disruptive events.

## Graph 5: US State vs Minimum Total Victim Count

![Correlation: US State vs Minimum Total Victim Count](./Correlation-US-state-min-total-victim-count.png)

The pie chart provides a visual comparison of the minimum total victim count across various US states. Each slice of the pie represents a state, with the size of the slice correlating to the number of victims reported.

**Creation** üõ†Ô∏è: I selected the top 15 states with the minimal victim counts as the slice criteria and set the total number of victims as the metric for the chart. Each slice of the pie represents a state, with the size indicating the number of victims; this visual format effectively communicates the comparative scale of victim counts in a clear, easily digestible manner.

Key Observations:
- **Lower Victim Counts** üìâ: States like Alabama and Mississippi show remarkably low minimum victim counts, potentially indicating effective crime prevention strategies or lower reporting rates in these regions.

- **Higher Counts in New Mexico** üìà: New Mexico, on the other hand, stands out with a significantly higher minimum number of victims, suggesting varying levels of criminal activity or differences in population density that could affect these numbers.
